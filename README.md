# React Static Site Template 2019

Little to see here. This is a static site template I can use to quickly ramp up on basic React projects.

## Installation

```cli
npm i
```

## Usage

Check ``package.json`` for OOB commands.
Write SCSS in ``stylesheets/`` and your React app in ``app/``.
Compiled files are produced in ``public/``.
